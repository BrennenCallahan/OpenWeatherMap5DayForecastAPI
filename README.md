Hey this code pulls results from https://openweathermap.org/ for the listed cities in the dictionary. It provides a 5 day weather forecast based on the average of each 24 hour period.
It contains the full dictionary for the JSON in C# so you can add fields as needed.
It is a MVC application written in C# and HTML/CSS to provide the example for API calls in C#, and JSON object access from a live API.
If you create a MVC application in dotnetfiddle, uploading each code to the appropriate model/view/controller, you can test it out for yourself!
Will also work on Visual Studio, however this requires more configuration if you're just finding this randomly!
